While learning the c programming language, these are some of the exercises and proects I have worked on.

++++++

++++++

Inside the exercise Directory are some smaller projects, a lot of simple functions i made to replace some of the built in functions provided in C libraries.
I wrote a lot of these to work simply, and they helped give me a better understanding of the C language and the library functions included.
To test them, they will need to be compiled with gcc or similair and ran through the command line.

++++++

Inside the project directory are some larger projects ive worked on, the later projects im working on using multiple files across directories for the program to work.
These will have makefile which will compile and make the programs.

++++++

++++++

Inside my_includes are a selection of the functions i wrote from the exercises, within one file to allow me to easily include them in a project.

This is very much an in progress learning that I am working on. This is just the C language work. In addition to this being updated I plan on learning 
more languages in the future.
